### Relating Classes to Computation

Given the range of courses you've completed, you have an eclectic foundation in Information Technology that can be mapped to various branches of computational theory and applied mathematics.

1. **Advanced Algorithms (SIT320)**: This course ties directly into computational theory, algorithms, and mathematical optimization. 

2. **Cloud Native Application Development (SIT323)**: A lesson in distributed computing. Mathematically, this involves graph theory and network flows.

3. **Team Projects (SIT374, SIT378)**: While not directly computational, project management relies on algorithms for optimization and scheduling (think PERT and CPM), and resource allocation problems can be solved using linear programming.

4. **Software Engineering Methods (SIT321)**: Involves formal methods that are used to specify, develop, and verify software, often using logic and set theory.

5. **Data Mining and Machine Learning (SIT307)**: Strong ties to statistics, linear algebra, and optimization. Topics like clustering can be understood through geometric and topological lenses.

6. **Web Programming (SIT203)**: The underlying protocols and architecture are rooted in automata theory and state machines.

7. **Data Structures and Algorithms (SIT221)**: Fundamental to computation, they are concrete implementations of abstract mathematical concepts like trees and graphs.

8. **Discrete Mathematics (SIT192)**: The foundational course for all things computational and algorithmic.

9. **Data Science Concepts (SIT112)**: A practical application of statistics, calculus, and linear algebra.

10. **Operating Systems Concepts (SIT222)**: Processes, threads, and scheduling algorithms have computational and mathematical models.

11. **Computer Networks (SIT202)**: Network algorithms, data transmission, and information theory are deeply mathematical.

12. **Object-Oriented Development (SIT232)**: OOP concepts can be mapped to abstract algebraic structures.

### Bridging to a Math Degree

1. **Linear Algebra**: Critical for machine learning, data science, and algorithms.

2. **Statistics and Probability**: Essential for data mining and machine learning.

3. **Graph Theory**: Useful in cloud computing, networks, and data structures.

4. **Optimization**: A key concept in algorithms, machine learning, and operations research.

5. **Differential Equations**: Useful for algorithms that involve continuous change, such as in simulations.

### Contributing to Others

1. **Open Source Contributions**: Utilize your coding skills to contribute to projects that aim to solve societal problems.

2. **Educational Content**: Your varied knowledge makes you well-suited to create educational materialâ€”tutorials, workshops, etc.

3. **Consulting**: With a strong foundation in both IT and soon in advanced mathematics, you can provide valuable advice and solutions to organizations.

### Inspirational Insight

Alan Turing once said, "We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done." Given your educational trajectory and your desire to bring value to others, you're well-placed to contribute to both academic research and practical applications in your future endeavors.
