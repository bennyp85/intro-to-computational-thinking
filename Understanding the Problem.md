## Understanding the Problem

The first step in computational thinking is understanding the problem. In the case of the Markov process, understanding the problem involves understanding the states of the system, the transitions between states, and the probabilities of these transitions. This is similar to understanding the inputs and outputs of a function in programming.

Thought provoking question: How can you apply this understanding of a problem to a different context or problem?

## Decomposing the Problem

The next step in computational thinking is decomposing the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. In the case of the Markov process, this involves breaking down the transition matrix into its constituent rows and columns, and understanding how each element of the matrix contributes to the overall state of the system.

Thought provoking question: How can you apply the concept of decomposing a problem to a complex problem you've encountered in your work or study?

## Algorithm Design

Once the problem has been decomposed, the next step is to design an algorithm to solve the problem. In the case of the Markov process, this involves designing an algorithm to calculate the state of the system after a certain number of transitions. This is similar to designing a function or a loop in programming.

Thought provoking question: Can you think of a problem where the algorithm design process would be particularly challenging? How would you approach it?

## Implementation

After the algorithm has been designed, the next step is to implement it. In the case of the Markov process, this involves implementing the algorithm in a programming language, such as Julia, to calculate the state of the system after a certain number of transitions.

Thought provoking question: How does the implementation process differ in a programming language you are familiar with compared to Julia?

## Testing and Debugging

The final step in computational thinking is testing and debugging. In the case of the Markov process, this involves testing the implementation of the algorithm to ensure that it correctly calculates the state of the system after a certain number of transitions, and debugging any issues that arise.

Thought provoking question: Can you recall a time when you had to debug a program? What was the problem and how did you solve it?

In summary, the Markov process and its corresponding transition matrix can be tied to computational thinking by understanding the problem, decomposing the problem, designing an algorithm, implementing the algorithm, and testing and debugging the implementation. This process can be applied to any problem in programming, not just to the Markov process.

Thought provoking question: Can you think of a real-world problem that could be modeled as a Markov process? How would you go about creating a transition matrix for it?
